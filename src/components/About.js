				{' '}
				I have been a civil trial attorney specializing in eminent domain
				litigation for over 30 years, joining the Dawson & Sodd law firm right
				out of Baylor Law School in 1989. Litigation has always been my focus. I
				participated as part of the acclaimed Baylor Mock Trial Competition Team
				and was honored to receive the Matt Dawson Award for Outstanding Trial
				Advocacy at Baylor. <br />
				<br />I “hit the ground running” trying eminent domain cases, and have
				been a shareholder at Dawson & Sodd for most of my legal career. I
				firmly believe my extensive trial and mediation experience handling
				hundreds of eminent domain cases over the past three decades uniquely
				qualifies me as a mediator specializing in this field. Only an eminent
				domain lawyer can understand the particular legal issues involved, the
				nuances of appraisals, and the motivations involved in a condemnation
				dispute. <br />
				<br />
				My philosophy as a trial lawyer has always been that understanding both
				sides of a case is absolutely essential to a successful outcome – and it
				is that same philosophy I will bring to the table as a mediator.
