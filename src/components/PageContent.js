					I have been a civil trial attorney specializing in eminent domain
					litigation for over 30 years, joining the Dawson & Sodd law firm right
					out of Baylor Law School in 1989. Litigation has always been my focus.
					I participated as part of the acclaimed Baylor Mock Trial Competition
					Team and was honored to receive the Matt Dawson Award for Outstanding
					Trial Advocacy at Baylor. I “hit the ground running” and have been a
					shareholder at Dawson & Sodd for most of my legal career. I firmly
					believe my extensive trial and mediation experience handling hundreds
					of eminent domain cases over the past three decades uniquely qualifies
					me as a mediator specializing in eminent domain. Only an eminent
					domain lawyer can understand the particular legal issues involved, the
					nuances of eminent domain appraisals, and the motivations of both
					sides involved in a condemnation dispute. My philosophy as a trial
					lawyer has always been that understanding both sides of a case is
					absolutely essential to a successful outcome – and it is that same
					philosophy I will bring to the table as a mediator.
